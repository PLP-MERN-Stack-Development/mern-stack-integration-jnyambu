# Client (Vite + React)

This is a minimal Vite + React scaffold added to the repository to let you run the frontend locally.

How to run

```powershell
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs on http://localhost:3000 by default.

You may add a `.env` file in `client/` for any environment variables.
